# Meaning-in-Temperatures

This repository accompanies the thesis **"The Meaning Behind Temperature: How Semantic Context Influences Large Language Model Climate Predictions"**.

The data used for all experiments can be found on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/guc1/Meaning-in-Temperatures/tree/main). A PDF snapshot of the dataset description is stored in `Final_scripts_used/dataset_description.pdf`.

The `Final_scripts_used` directory contains the scripts used for fine-tuning, inference and evaluation. Each subfolder includes a small README describing its contents.
